## CptS360 Project: Skeleton Layout
# Please read!

Hello everyone! Here is something to help you out as you start the project. This repo includes skeleton code as well as a few comments for where to find algorithms and such for your perusal.

### A few (bunch of) things to keep in mind:
- A lot of guidance (including code) can be found in the book! It's fine to get exact code from the book, but be careful copy pasting. Font could be screwy and variable names can be different depending on globals and other set-up.
- You don't have to keep function parameters, include statements, etc. the exact same as in this repo originally, HOWEVER: KCW has particular expectations as far as which files your functions will be in and how many functions you have in your final turn in. This repo immitates his requirements, and includes the necessary setup to avoid circular references. Feel free to differ from it! But keep in mind that there will be a final layout for how your program structure is set up file-wise and function-wise.
- Not all return statements included here are final. There are return statements in place to prevent warnings, but return statements in your program should mean something (success, failure, etc). A few return statements have explicit comments for what they should be changed to, but some of them don't and still should be changed.
- Just because something exists doesn't mean you have to use it. If you see a global variable that you aren't referencing, or some function declaration that's causing an issue and isn't being utilized, don't force yourself to make use of it! It's ok to comment out/delete it and come back to it later if you find it necessary eventually (or don't, that's ok too). Everything will be here in your GitHub history.
- Just because something doesn't exist doesn't mean you don't need it. If you find yourself wanting to make changes to the template provided here, or can't figure out how something should work, don't avoid making changes because you think that it must be wrong. This is only a template and isn't pulled from a key. Just make sure that you follow KCW's requested layout of all the files at the end of the project.
- Pay attention to what's being asked of you. The project specification is given both on the website and in the book. The website is the end-all be-all as to what the graded aspects of the project will be. Read carefully to make sure you don't miss a requirement!

## Some final pleas:
### PUSH YOUR CODE OFTEN
VMs crash, files get corrupted, entire computers can die. And sometimes, you can't for the life of you figure out what changed to break your code. Commit often, push often, and you'll have a paper trail of all your progress.
'Often' does not mean weekly, it doesn't even mean daily. Commit and push everytime you make some progress that you'd really rather not lose.
### If you fall behind, ask for help
This project is iterative. Later functions may require earlier functions, and some functions like ls are the only way to prove that other functions are working at all. It's better to make sure that what you have works well than to attempt to move forward if your foundation is shaky.
### Use your resources
The book, TAs, tutors, fellow classmates, KCW, there're a lot of ways out there to get help.
If you want help from TAs specifically, either email all of us or email one of us and CC all of the rest of us. It's important for us all to be up to date on what's going on. Plus, your chances of getting a quick response are higher.

#### Also just a reminder: This is a repo for your reference, there'll be a different one for the actual github classroom assignment.
